This crate is designed to be a bunch of tools for interacting with the Steam API.

# To-do

- [ ] Add `serde` feature to `steamkit-vdf`.
- [ ] Maybe add a way to generate `.vdf` files from a node-tree?
- [ ] Create a crate that handles building protobufs using Rust's build process.
- [ ] Create a crate that handles connection/protocol stuff?
- [ ] Create a crate that wraps common stuff.
